Filesystem

#File::Spec -> Hides differences between file systems 
	cudir = current directory
	updir = up one directory tree level
	
	File::Spec:Functions -> same thing, easier syntax
#Path::Class -> imported module, even easier syntax.  Good for OS indepe						ndent code  

**basically for file system code, you need to write a scan directory routine of some kind and then call it recursively for various conditions

**Even further everything in Unix is a file written in text.  Use regexps to search them intelligenetly.
